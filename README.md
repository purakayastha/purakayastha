- 👋 Hi, I’m @purakayastha
- 👀 I’m interested in being a Python master! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I studied computer science back in 2003. I have worked in Java and PHP. But that was until 2005 when I got distracted 
and started working in the manufacturing sector. I now want to be a digital nomad, and I believe this would be possible using my coding skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python projects. I'm a bit rusty, but I know i can really help.
